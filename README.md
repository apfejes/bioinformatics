Welcome to the r/bioinformatics code repository.  

Here are the rules - which may be subject to change.

1.  All code checked in must be in python (to start... we may change this.)
2.  All code must pass pylint - or have pylint ignore statements.
3.  All code must pass code review by one "senior" python developer. 

How to do code review:

How to propose new ideas:

The idea page is a space to put ideas that haven't been fully formed. This can be
just notes or partially formed thoughts about your interests/skills. As ideas begin
to take shape, we will create a folder for more formal, fleshed out proposals. That will
be added in later, but for now the ideas page and slack chat are where the brainstorming will happen

How to join the project:

Please join our slack channel by sending a PM to apfejes on reddit.
