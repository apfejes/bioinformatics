Description: # r/bioinformatics
        
        Welcome to the r/bioinformatics code repository.  
        
        ## Rules
        
        Here are the rules - which may be subject to change.
        
        1. All code checked in must be in python (to start... we may change this.)
        2. All code must pass pylint - or have pylint ignore statements.
        3. All code must pass code review by one "senior" python developer. 
        
        ## How to do code review
        
        ## How to propose new ideas
        For now, it is best to put new ideas on the [project ideas page](https://github.com/apfejes/bioinformatics/blob/master/idea-page.md), following the
        instructions contained there. This page and the slack channel will be used for much of our early brainstorming. As the ideas get more fleshed out, we'll create a folder
        for formal proposals. Until that point though, please use the ideas page. 
        
        ## How to join the project
        
        Please join our slack channel by sending a PM to [apfejes](https://www.reddit.com/user/apfejes) on reddit.
